## Project 01 - Alert Investigation

### Objectives
- Analyze affected entities and attack indicators
- Determine whether an alert should be classified as True Positive or False Positive
- Assess whether escalation is necessary
- Explain the rationale behind classification and escalation decisions
- Provide appropriate recommendations for remediation

### Environment & Tools
This project uses the Cloud-Based SOC Simulator: “Introduction to Phishing” provided by TryHackMe to analyze, investigate, classify, and write security alert reports.
