The firewall detected that the source IP `10.20.2.25` associated with the email recipient, attempted to access that URL. The URL pointed to an unknown IP address :`45.148.10.131`, and this correlated event occurred at 09/17/2026 03:51.

An analysis of the destination IP using TryDetectThis returned a MALICIOUS status.<br>

This activity indicates a phishing attempt and a spoofed email domain. No further suspicious activity was identified in the available telemetry.

### Classification & Escalation
| Classification | Escalation                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| True Positive  | Further investigation required  |

### Final Assessment
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the user and the internal IP address received a phishing email sent from a spoofed Microsoft domain, and the firewall detected that the user attempted to access the destination URL and IP address, which were flagged as MALICIOUS.

Since the user accessed a malicious URL and the firewall allowed the connection, escalation is essential to determine whether any payload, malicious content, or further activity reached the endpoint.

### Remediation Recommendation
- Monitor the affected user and endpoint
- Review endpoint activity after URL access
- Review DNS/proxy/network logs for related activity
- Block the malicious URL and IP address
- Isolate the endpoint if compromise is confirmed
- Update email and web security controls
- Provide phishing awareness training to the user
